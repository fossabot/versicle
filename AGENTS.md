All code changes require running the playwrite tests to ensure that nothing is broken.
Where applicable, new playwrite tests should be created.

**Important:**
1. All Playwright tests must record a screenshot for key steps to assist in verification and debugging.
2. Whenever tests are run or updated, the generated screenshots in `verification/screenshots/` must be committed to the repository to serve as a visual reference for the current state.
